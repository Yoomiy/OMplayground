# Voxel UI review follow-up

First repair batch for the 2026-10-29 source review of `90fe575`.

| Review findings | Implemented behavior |
| --- | --- |
| UI-01, UI-06 | Item thumbnails use the actual world models and textures. Hotbar and inventory show stack counts and durability. Survival health, food and air have graphical meters; air also shows seconds. |
| UI-02, UI-03, UI-05 | Compact nine-slot hotbar, stone-colored inventory and smaller floating header. Session management lives in a menu. Mining progress stays beside the crosshair. |
| UI-04 | Confirmed mining progress drives a target-shaped crack overlay, repeating arm swings and digging effects. |
| UI-07, BUG-06 | Empty equipment destinations show their names. Selecting an item highlights compatible equipment destinations. |
| UI-08, BUG-05 | Searchable visual recipe grids, result thumbnails and ingredient availability. Recipe expansion/search survive pending transactions and inventory revisions. |
| UI-09 | Drag stacks, right-click a source to select half, right-click a destination for one item, and Shift-click for quick transfer. Transactions remain server-authoritative. |
| UI-10 | Searchable image catalog. Choosing a block replaces the current creative quick-access slot; digits always address the nine visible slots. |
| UI-11 | Right-click opens a targeted workbench or chest. Holding Shift bypasses opening and allows placement beside it. |
| UI-12 | Help explains survival hold mining, sprint, sneak, creative flight, slot selection and TNT ignition. |
| BUG-01, BUG-02 | A brief input gap or authoritative ray miss pauses mining for up to 200 ms before cancellation. No mining ticks accrue during that interruption. Movement still expires after 100 ms. Block replacement, tool changes, focus loss and permission loss still invalidate mining. |
| BUG-03 | Release may finish only the final two valid server ticks. Earlier release cancels immediately. |
| BUG-04 | Transient gameplay rejection messages remain visible during normal play, with three seconds to read them. |
| BUG-07, BUG-08 | E respects other open dialogs. Pointer-lock rejection displays retry guidance and freezes local input. |

## Local checks

- The 14 native survival tests pass, including new input-gap/aim-miss and near-completion release regressions.
- A focused local browser flow rendered the production React surface with the native game worker. It checked nine image slots, compact header geometry, inventory split/drag/quick transfers, durability bars, recipe state/search, modal shortcut isolation, survival meters, gameplay rejection text and pointer-lock retry guidance.
- Workbench/chest opening and the continuous mining presentation still need hands-on feedback in normal play. The local browser station-placement attempt did not establish a stable station target, so it is not evidence of successful station interaction.
- Game and web TypeScript checks and updated client/server packaging pass. Existing engine sources, toolchain configuration and Wasm artifacts match the prior published hashes; that unchanged engine is reused because this executor has no Rust compiler.

## Remaining review items

Full graphics reconstruction after WebGL context loss (BUG-09) and third-person camera support (BUG-10) remain open. Terrain artwork remains a separate visual review (UI-13).

# Hardening checklist (Railway + Supabase)

Operational notes for production. Aligned with `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `tmp/logging_coverage_prototype.md`.

**Last updated:** June 2026.

## Auth signup

- **Supabase Auth public signup must stay disabled** in the Supabase dashboard. Kids and teachers are created only via admin Edge Functions (`import-bulk-kids`, `admin-create-user`). Self-service `kid_profiles` INSERT is not relied on for onboarding.

## Rate limiting

- **HTTP:** `express-rate-limit` on both Node servers (120 req/min per IP default).
- **Telemetry ingest:** Stricter per-IP limits on `/api/telemetry` (see `packages/observability`).
- **Auth / messaging / reports:** Add stricter limits on dedicated routes or Edge Functions as surfaces grow.

## Logs and metrics

- **Shared package:** `@playground/observability` — Pino JSON logs, correlation IDs, whitelisted socket event logging (no per-tick spam).
- **game-server:** `initObservability` wired (replacing raw `morgan` + scattered `console.*`).
- **minecraft-server:** Package linked; full Pino wiring in progress.
- **Production:** Ship stdout to Railway log drains (Axiom / Datadog / BetterStack). Query by `service`, `correlationId`, `level`, `protocol`.
- **Client crashes:** Buffered telemetry → server `/api/telemetry` → Pino (`protocol: client`).
- **Do not log:** raw socket payloads, chat bodies, JWTs, LiveKit tokens, per-tick voxel `INPUT`/`SNAPSHOT`.

## Health and readiness

- `GET /health` — process up.
- `GET /ready` — required Supabase env vars present (URL, service role; JWT secret where applicable).

## Admin stats (app-level)

- `GET /api/admin/stats` per server — requires `admin_profiles` bearer JWT.
- **On-Demand Live Flushing**: When `/api/admin/stats` is requested, the servers run `onAdminStatsQuery` to flush all active rooms' in-memory launches and FPS telemetry to the database before returning the stats snapshot.
- **Polling Optimization**: The Admin UI pauses polling `/api/admin/stats` requests when the tab is hidden, preventing background tabs from generating redundant REST requests and database writes.
- **Historical stats**: Admin UI displays a grid of catalog games with aggregated launch counts and details on player history/multiplayer sessions.

## Audit trail

- Privileged admin/teacher actions → Supabase `audit_log` via `append_audit_log` RPC.
- Optional `correlation_id` in metadata (logging spec).

## WebSocket scaling

- Single instance: in-memory rooms only.
- **Multi-instance:** sticky sessions + **Redis** adapter for Socket.io pub/sub (documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Load / soak

- Run soak tests against both Railway WS endpoints and Supabase Realtime before high-traffic windows.
- Record connection counts, voxel snapshot rates, and reconnect behavior.
- Validate: 60 s of voxel play produces **zero** log lines for `INPUT` / tick `SNAPSHOT`.

## Platform dashboards (infra — not in-app)

| Signal | Where |
|--------|-------|
| Node CPU, memory, restarts | Railway per-service metrics |
| HTTP 5xx, latency | Railway / Vercel |
| Postgres, RLS | Supabase dashboard |
| WebRTC / voice | LiveKit dashboard |
